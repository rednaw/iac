# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing — that’s awesome! 🎉
All kinds of contributions are welcome: code, docs, ideas, bug reports, or
just thoughtful feedback.

## A Few Ground Rules

* Be kind and respectful
* Keep changes focused and easy to review
* Follow existing patterns where possible
* Write clear commit messages

Perfection isn’t required — improvement is.

---

## Licensing of Contributions

By contributing, you agree that:

* Your contribution is your own work (or you have permission to submit it)
* Your contribution will be licensed under the same license as the project

This keeps things simple and consistent for everyone.

---

## Name & Branding

Contributing code does not grant rights to use the project’s name or branding.

Forks and derivative projects should follow the guidelines in
[`TRADEMARK.md`](./TRADEMARK.md) so users can easily tell what’s official and
what’s not.

## How to Contribute

Typical flow:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch
3. Make your changes
4. Run checks if applicable
5. Open a pull request and explain what you changed and why

Small PRs are easier to review and merge.

---

## Reporting Issues

When opening an issue, it helps to include:

* What you expected to happen
* What actually happened
* How to reproduce it (if possible)
* Relevant logs or snippets

---

## Community Expectations

This project aims to be a welcoming, low-drama place to collaborate.
Harassment, discrimination, or hostile behavior won’t be tolerated.

If something feels off, please speak up.
