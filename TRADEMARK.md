# Trademark & Name Usage

We want this project to be easy to use, fork, and build upon — while also
avoiding confusion about what is *official* and what is not.

This document explains how the project name **“Rednaw Infrastructure”**
(and any associated logos or branding) may be used.

---

## The Short Version

* ✅ Use the code freely
* ✅ Talk about the project
* ✅ Say your work is based on it
* ❌ Don’t pretend your fork is the original
* ❌ Don’t use the name or logo in a way that confuses people

That’s it.

## What’s Totally Fine

You’re welcome to:

* Refer to the project by name in docs, blog posts, talks, or tutorials
* Say your setup is “based on” or “inspired by” this project
* Link to the official repository
* Use the name when discussing unmodified versions of the project

Example:

> “Our infrastructure is based on Rednaw Infrastructure.”

## What Needs Permission

Please don’t, without asking first:

* Use the project name or logo for a fork or modified version
* Use the branding to imply endorsement or official status
* Use the name or logo for a commercial product or hosted service
* Present your project in a way that could confuse users about where it comes from

---

## Forks Are Welcome ❤️

Forking is encouraged!

If you publish a fork or derivative project, please:

* Pick a different name
* Remove or replace logos and branding
* Clearly state that your project is a fork

Example:

> “This project is forked from Rednaw Infrastructure.”

This keeps things clear and friendly for everyone.

## Logos & Visual Identity

Logos and branding assets are not covered by the code license and aren’t
automatically reusable. If you’d like to use them, just reach out.

## Questions?

We’re happy to clarify.
