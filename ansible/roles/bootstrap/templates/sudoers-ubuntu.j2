# Sudo configuration for ubuntu user
# Passwordless sudo with comprehensive logging
#
# Security Note: NOPASSWD:ALL grants unlimited passwordless sudo access.
# This is an accepted security trade-off for this application because:
# - SSH access is restricted to specific IP addresses via Hetzner firewall
# - SSH authentication is key-based only (password auth disabled)
# - Fail2ban protects against brute force attacks
# - Comprehensive audit logging captures all sudo activity (see below)
# - This is a gift finder application, not a financial institution
#
# If the ubuntu account is compromised, an attacker would have full root access.
# The logging below helps with post-incident forensics, but prevention relies
# on the SSH security measures mentioned above.
